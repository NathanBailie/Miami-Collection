# Miami Collection

## Description
I found the idea for this project in one of the tutorials on [WebDesign Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX1HZnhJLGM) YouTube channel. This is a site with beautiful animations. There is an animation of disappearance and appearance of the title on the trigger, the card increases by clicking on it, when scrolling the cards have a parallax effect.
